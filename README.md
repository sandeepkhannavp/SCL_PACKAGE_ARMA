# SCL_PACKAGE_ARMA

Implementation of Auto-Regressive Moving Average (ARMA) model and generating the predicted results. 

For (20XT56) Scientific Computing Lab @PSG COLLEGE OF TECHNOLOGY

-> Implemention of ARMA model on the “NIFTY 50” index dataset acquired from the yahoo API to forecast. An ARMA model, or Auto-regressive Moving Average model, is used to describe weakly stationary stochastic time series in terms of two polynomials. The first of these polynomials is for auto-regression, the second for the moving average. Often this model is referred to as the ARMA(p,q) model; where: p is the order of the auto-regressive polynomial, q is the order of the moving average polynomial.

-> In the code, separate functions have been created for Auto Regressive and Moving Average. Stationary test has been done using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test. Based on the residuals obtained from AR model, MA has been implemented. Plots have been used to back our results and predicted values.
